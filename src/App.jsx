Nee enna enna vena nenachukoâ€”greedy, jealous, egoisticâ€”but the truth is, i was scared, i was just scared that Iâ€™ll be replacedâ€¦ that I donâ€™t matter to you like how much you matter to me.

Even after you told me that you're bestfriend is dharaniya and no one'd ever replace her, i never wanted her to be replaced, she's special for you, and i just wanted to be good enough, like, naanu unnoda oru bestfriend aa irrukanunu expect panne, but i was wrong, you know, oru person special la illayanu neetha decide pannanu, not me, i have no idea why the hell i told like that, that was just so childish and i'll try not to do that again.....  Best friendship mathiri feelings varanum nu solli vara kodathu, adhu natural-a nadakkanum. Forcing is not friendship, and Iâ€™m sorry for that. Naan deserve pannala nu naan purinjutaen. 

And second, naan un mela control panna try pannaen nu nee feel pannuna, Iâ€™m truly sorry. Honestly, i never wanted to control you, never, did i ever told you to stop texting with any boys. Tamim matter-la I agree, but even then, naan un safety-ku dhaan sonna, not to control you. But still, adhu wrong-a thaan pochu. Unakku oru naal hurt aagidumo nu than naan yosichaen. Aana naan ippo purinjutaen, nee un life-a nee decide pannalaam. I trust you, and Iâ€™ll never do anything like that again.

And third, naan un kitta chinna chinna things force panna try pannaen, like â€˜broâ€™ ku badhila â€˜daâ€™ nu solla sonnaen. That was immature. Every time nee bro nu sonna, I felt like something was breaking between us. Aana adhu en imagination dhaan. I shouldâ€™ve respected your way of talking. Iâ€™m sorry for that too.

I know naan neraiya thappu pannaen, but everything came from a place of caring and fear......`
